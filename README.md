# DER-API
This Repository Contain Code for Dog Emotion Recognition

I have Made a Website for Dog Emotion Recognition Model with Backend in FLask Framework.

### key Features of this Website are:
- User can upload image of dog and get the emotion of dog.
- The site also show the image of dog with emotion.
- Deep Learning Model is used for Dog Emotion Recognition.
- The model is trained on 15,000 images of dogs.
- The model is trained on 4 different emotions of dog.
- Transfer Learning is used for training the model.
- The model is trained on EfficientNetB0 Architecture.
- The model is trained on Kaggle GPU.

#### Frontend
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Bootstrap
#### Backend:
- Python
- Flask
- Kaggle GPU
- EfficientNetB0 Architecture
- Transfer Learning
- Deep Learning
- Tensorflow
- Keras
